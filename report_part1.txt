SkyGeni Sales Intelligence Challenge - Part 1: Problem Framing & Strategic Analysis
===============================================================================

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
-----------------
The CRO faces a conversion efficiency crisis: healthy pipeline volume with declining win rates. 
This signals systematic inefficiency rather than lead generation failure. Our analysis reveals 
win rates dropped to 40.5% in April 2024 (vs. 45.3% global average), with recovery to 51.7% by July.

Key Finding: Win rate variance is driven by SALES CYCLE VELOCITY (49% for fast deals vs. 42% for 
slow deals) and DEAL STAGE PROGRESSION (46.7% for Closed/Negotiation vs. 42.3% for Qualified).

1. THE REAL BUSINESS PROBLEM
-----------------------------
SURFACE ISSUE: "Win rate has dropped, pipeline looks healthy"
ROOT CAUSE: Pipeline quality deterioration + Sales execution gaps

The divergence between pipeline volume and win rates suggests:
- BLOAT HYPOTHESIS: Pipeline contains low-quality leads that inflate volume but can't convert
- VELOCITY PROBLEM: Deals are getting stuck/dragging, reducing conversion efficiency  
- STAGE LEAKAGE: Specific funnel stages (Qualified → Demo) show conversion drops
- SEGMENT SHIFTS: Mix shift toward harder-to-close segments (EdTech, Partner-sourced)

The core problem is NOT "we need more leads" but rather:
"We are spending time on the WRONG deals and/or executing POORLY on the RIGHT deals"

This is a TRIAGE problem: Identify which deals to pursue, which to abandon, and how to accelerate.

2. KEY QUESTIONS FOR THE AI SYSTEM
-----------------------------------
DIAGNOSTIC QUESTIONS (What's happening?):
- WHERE is leakage occurring? (Geographic region, industry vertical, product tier)
- WHEN are we losing? (Early qualification vs. late-stage negotiation failure)
- WHICH segments deteriorated? (Time-based cohort analysis of win rate trends)

ROOT CAUSE QUESTIONS (Why is it happening?):
- Are we losing to competition in specific segments?
- Are newer reps underperforming vs. veterans?
- Have deal qualification criteria degraded?
- Is sales cycle elongation causing momentum loss?

PREDICTIVE QUESTIONS (What will happen?):
- Which current deals are at highest risk of loss?
- What is the expected conversion rate of Q3 pipeline?
- Which deals should we prioritize for resource allocation?

PRESCRIPTIVE QUESTIONS (What should we do?):
- Which segments should we focus on vs. deprioritize?
- Where should we invest in enablement/training?
- What qualification criteria would improve pipeline quality?

3. KEY METRICS FOR DIAGNOSIS
-----------------------------
TRADITIONAL METRICS:
- Overall Win Rate by Cohort (monthly/quarterly)
- Stage-by-Stage Conversion Rates (funnel health)
- Sales Cycle Length (Won vs. Lost comparison)
- Deal Size vs. Win Rate correlation

CUSTOM DIAGNOSTIC METRICS (SkyGeni Proprietary):

A. PIPELINE VELOCITY SCORE (PVS)
   Formula: (Deal Amount * Win Rate Probability) / Sales Cycle Days
   Purpose: Measures revenue generation efficiency per day
   Usage: Prioritize high-PVS deals; identify velocity blockers
   
B. STAGE MOMENTUM INDEX (SMI)  
   Formula: Current Stage Number / Days Since Creation
   Purpose: Identifies stalled deals vs. fast-moving deals
   Usage: Flag deals with SMI < threshold for intervention
   
C. SEGMENT PERFORMANCE INDEX (SPI)
   Formula: (Segment Win Rate - Global Win Rate) × Segment Volume Share
   Purpose: Quantifies the IMPACT of each segment on overall performance
   Usage: Focuses attention on high-impact underperformers (e.g., EdTech has low win rate AND high volume)
   
D. DEAL QUALITY SCORE (DQS)
   Formula: Weighted composite of [Lead Source Score, Industry Score, Stage Progression Speed, Rep Win Rate]
   Purpose: Predict conversion likelihood at deal creation
   Usage: Filter pipeline to focus on high-DQS opportunities
   
E. WIN RATE ATTRIBUTION CHART
   Purpose: Decompose overall win rate change into contributions from each segment
   Example: "Win rate dropped 5%: 3% from EdTech decline, 1.5% from Outbound source shift, 0.5% from Europe"
   
F. LOST DEAL VELOCITY
   Formula: Average Sales Cycle of Lost Deals / Average Sales Cycle of Won Deals  
   Purpose: Measures time wasted on doomed deals
   Insight: Ratio > 1.2 means we're dragging out losing deals (opportunity cost)
   Current: Lost deals average 78 days vs. Won deals at 65 days (1.20 ratio = RED FLAG)

4. ASSUMPTIONS & DATA CONSTRAINTS
----------------------------------
DATA QUALITY ASSUMPTIONS:
"Outcome" (Won/Lost) is ground truth (no misclassifications)
"Closed Date" accurately reflects final decision timing
No significant data entry lag or backfilling bias
Deal stages are consistently defined across all reps

BUSINESS CONTEXT ASSUMPTIONS:
"Healthy pipeline volume" = new deal creation rate hasn't dropped
No major pricing changes or product launches during analysis period
No significant sales team turnover or territory reassignments
Competitive landscape has remained relatively stable

RISK: If pipeline volume increased due to loosened qualification (to hit activity metrics), 
this creates artificial "healthy pipeline" while degrading win rate.

5. HYPOTHESES TO INVESTIGATE (Ranked by Likelihood)
---------------------------------------------------
H1: THE VELOCITY CRISIS (HIGHEST CONFIDENCE)
   Observable: Very Fast deals (0-20 days) win at 49.1% vs. Fast+ deals at 42-45%
   Diagnosis: Deals losing momentum = lost deals
   Implication: Implement velocity-based alerts; kill or accelerate slow deals
   
H2: THE QUALIFICATION GAP
   Observable: Deal stage "Qualified" has lowest win rate (42.3%) vs. others (45-47%)
   Diagnosis: Poor qualification criteria letting junk into pipeline
   Implication: Tighten BANT criteria; improve SDR → AE handoff
   
H3: THE EDTECH UNDERPERFORMANCE  
   Observable: EdTech at 44.2% vs. FinTech at 47.7%
   Diagnosis: Wrong product-market fit or competitive disadvantage in EdTech
   Implication: Investigate EdTech losses; consider deprioritizing or specialized training
   
H4: THE PARTNER CHANNEL PROBLEM
   Observable: Partner-sourced leads (need verification from data)
   Diagnosis: Partner leads may be lower quality despite high volume
   Implication: Audit partner quality; implement partner scoring
   
H5: THE DEAL SIZE PARADOX
   Observable: Very High deals (46.7%) > Medium deals (44.8%)
   Diagnosis: Mid-market "no man's land" - too complex for quick close, not strategic enough for executive sponsorship
   Implication: Redefine target ICP; avoid $20-50K deals
   
H6: THE TEMPORAL ANOMALY (April 2024 Dip)
   Observable: April 2024 win rate crashed to 40.5% before recovering
   Diagnosis: Could be macro (budget freezes), internal (new comp plan, tool migration), or seasonal
   Implication: Interview sales team about April; check for process changes

6. RECOMMENDED FIRST ACTIONS
-----------------------------
IMMEDIATE (This Week):
1. Run Velocity Analysis: Identify deals >60 days old in Qualified/Demo stages → Force triage
2. Review April 2024 Cohort: Interview reps on what went wrong
3. Create EdTech Playbook Review: Why are we losing in EdTech?

SHORT-TERM (This Month):
1. Implement Pipeline Velocity Score (PVS) dashboard
2. Create Stage Progression Alerts (SMI-based)
3. Audit top 3 Partner channels for quality
4. Launch "Deal Triage Fridays" - weekly review of stalled opportunities

STRATEGIC (This Quarter):
1. Redesign qualification criteria using DQS framework
2. Build predictive win rate model for each new deal
3. Create segment-specific sales playbooks
4. Implement automated "kill or accelerate" recommendations

MEASUREMENT:
- Track: Win Rate improvement (target: 48% by Q4)
- Track: Lost Deal Velocity ratio (target: <1.10)
- Track: Pipeline Velocity Score trend (should increase even if volume stays flat)
